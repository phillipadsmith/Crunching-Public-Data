Thanks for your interest in Crunching Public Data. I'm your instructor, [Phillip Smith](http://phillipadsmith.com), and I'll be leading you through the coursework over the four weeks that the course runs in April 2012.

### Course format 

This is the first time that I'm running this course online, so feedback is very welcome (shoot me an [e-mail](http://phillipadsmith.com/#contact) or drop a note in the comments here).

There will be four units in this course, one week each, and each unit will consist of:

* Suggested readings or video material to provide context or inspiration
* At least one video lecture on the subject of the unit, delivered by me, or an expert in the field
* Several challenges to test your understanding of the material, and to assist you with integrating the ideas or skills from the unit into your personal project
* A Q & A forum where we can discuss the unit's content, and where I can answer any questions that you have

The course is designed to be learner-driven and doesn't require you to be "in class" at any specific time. However, you should be prepared to invest at least five-to-ten hours per week for the duration of the course. During that time, I will be available to help with your coursework, answer any questions you have, and provide one-on-one support via Skype or Internet Relay Chat. 

### Personal project

As a participant, your first assignment will be to brainstorm ideas, gather feedback, and commit to a personal project that you will work on for the duration of the course. Your personal project should be something that you're excited to explore in the context of the course material, and something that you can complete start-to-finish in four weeks. You should be thinking "[minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)," not kitchen sink. We'll do this together in a Q&A forum once the course gets underway.

### Course outline

The course outline is currently as follows:

* Unit 1: Sourcing public data
* Unit 2: Exploring data, Part I
* Unit 3: Exploring data, Part II
* Unit 4: Visualizing data

Each unit will build on the previous week's with the objective of incrementally improving your ability to:

* Identify questions that data might be able to answer
* Find or obtain the data that you need
* Quickly assess what's in the data, no matter how large the dataset
* Prepare the data for a thorough investigation
* Present your findings in a meaningful and engaging way

### The goal of this course

By the end of the course I would like you to become a confident, intermediate level data diver, ready to take on larger independent challenges. You can't become a data guru in four weeks but being at ease with the concepts, confident about where to find answers, and knowing how to progress further can be picked up in this time.

### How the course will work

To progress with this course, you’ll be reading materials produced both by me and others. I've curated the content to suit a general newcomer to data crunching but if you need something more specific, let me know. If things are too advanced, too slow, or you otherwise think I can help you get more out of the course, I'm happy to hear constructive feedback and recommendations on how to adjust the course to meet your needs.

As well as reading, you’ll be doing a lot of experimenting. Data crunching is all about "doing" and I'll be encouraging you to try as many different things as possible. This depends a lot on how much time you have to invest in the course. Some of you will only have time to do the bare minimum, whereas some of you will have extra hours to devote to playing about with the ideas and tools that you've learned. Either is fine as long as you're happy. You can always refer to the materials once the course has ended.

As you progress through the materials, there will be "challenges" to complete for each unit. The first one of these is TK. 

### Help is only an Internet connection away

If you need any help, you should post in the CodeLesson forum and I will respond ASAP (within the day, Monday-Friday during the course dates).

You can also [e-mail me](http://phillipadsmith.com/#contact) with personal questions, though I would prefer that any general questions and discussions stay on the forums here so that everyone can benefit from the back and forth.

With all of that, welcome to the course, good luck and I look forward to talking to you soon.

### What to do next

After reading this document I'd recommend:
