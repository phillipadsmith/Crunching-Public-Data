Howdy,

Thanks for your interest in Crunching Public Data. I'm your instructor, Phillip Smith, and I'll be leading you through the coursework over the four weeks that the course runs.

There will be four units, one week each, and each unit will consist of:

* Suggested readings or video material
* At least one video lecture on the topic of the unit, delivered by me, or an expert in the field
* At least one quiz to test our understanding of the topic
* At least one assignment to assist you with integrating the lessons from the unit into your personal project
* A Q & A forum where we can discuss the unit's content, and where I can answer any questions that you have
