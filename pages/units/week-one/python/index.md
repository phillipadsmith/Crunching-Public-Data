## Learning Python the hard way

> Have you always wanted to learn how to code but never thought you could? Are you looking to build a foundation for more complex coding? Do you want to challenge your brain in a new way? Then Learn Python the Hard Way is the book for you.

In the same spirit of hands-on learning that this course embraces, the book "[Learning Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)" also strives to teach by providing practical exercises that will help you move forward in small steps. I can't recommend the book enough; it's a great place to start learning the Python programming language, and a decent way to start understanding programming principles that apply to any language. The author, Zed A. Shaw, [has made the book available at no cost in HTML format that you can read online](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). 

## Why we're using Python 

The honest answer to why we're going to use Python in this course is because the founder of Code Lesson, Jeffrey McManus, is a big fan of Python. If I had my druthers, we'd do the exercises in [Perl](http://perl.org). But Python is what all the cool kids like to use these days and, more than that, it's a fine language and quite easy to pick-up. 

Python, like Perl and [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org), is quite good at processing text (among many other things) and comes pre-installed on most modern operating systems like Apple's OS X, Linux, and is straightforward to install on Windows.

## How we'll be using it

Crunching Public Data isn't a programming course, so you don't have to worry too much about your Python proficiency. That said, learning a little Python hasn't ever hurt anyone (at least that I'm aware of). In this course, you'll likely be using Python to:

* Quickly explore and work with large text files, specifically comma-separated values files (simple spreadsheet files)
* Locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe
* Scrape data from Web sites that don't provide their information in a downloadable format

In each case, I'll provide an alternative to using Python, if you feel that it's too steep a learning curve for you. That said, I highly encourage you to give it a shot. (And, if you're more familiar with another language, you can just stick with that for the exercises.)

## Where to go next

* [Challenge No. 4: Install Python (Est. 30 minutes)]()
* [Challenge No. 5 (optional): Try exercises TK, TK, and TK from the _Learning Python the hard way_ book. (Est. 1 hour)]()
