title: "Challenge No. 4: Install Python"
---
{% include JB/setup %}

This is an easy challenge. Simply follow the instructions in [Exercise 0: The Setup](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html) of _Learning Python The Hard Way_ to install a text editor and Python (or check if it's installed).

If you already have a text editor that you're familiar with, you can stick with that.

If you know that you already have Python installed, than you're almost done this challenge.

To complete the challenge, simply post in the [course forum](http://learn.codelesson.com/mod/forum/view.php?id=3386) what version of Python you have running. That would be the output from the <code>'python -v'</code> command executed in your terminal program (if this last sentence made no sense to you, go back to sentence one and follow the link).

Don't spend more than 30 minutes on this. If you get stuck, simply post in the course forum or find me online (in the IRC chat room or on Skype) to get some help.
