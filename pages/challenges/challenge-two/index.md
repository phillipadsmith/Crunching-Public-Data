title: "Challenge No. 2: Propose investigations: questions that you want to answer"

{% include JB/setup %}

The first step in successfully crunching public data is brainstorming a list of ideas that you might like to explore over the next four weeks. These can be questions that you've been keen to investigate for some time, or ideas that popped-up for you while reviewing this weeks material. They can be ideas where you don't know if the data exists, or ideas that you come up with while browsing through the list of possible public data sources. There are no restrictions or limits here.

Please set aside 1-2 hours for this exercise. I'd like each participant to sketch out at least three ideas or possible investigations. Each idea should be described on two sentences or less. You are welcome to propose as many ideas as you can come up with.

The goal of this exercise is for you to practice some [ideation]() and [thinking out loud]() and to get some quick feedback from your co-participants and the instructor. 

From here, you'll likely refine one or two ideas to the point where they are clear, simple, and achievable enough that you can work on these one or two investigations over the next four weeks.

When you've got your ideas ready to propose, please post them in the [course forum](http://learn.codelesson.com/mod/forum/view.php?id=3386). Feel free to also post them to your personal blog.
