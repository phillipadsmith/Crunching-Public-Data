title: "Challenge No. 3: List data sets that might be useful to your investigation"
---
{% include JB/setup %}

This is an extension of [Challenge No. 2](http://phillipadsmith.github.com/Crunching-Public-Data//pages/challenges/challenge-two/index.html). For each of the ideas you've proposed -- or, at least, for the first one or two -- take some time to start thinking about where you might find the information you need to proceed with the investigation. Is the data already available online? If so, where is it? If it's not on a site [already listed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-85AiKMnBIXfWj5FL43ms60U9H09r-TTdJyTV5Apww/edit), where else might you look for the data? If you can't find it online, who could you approach or ask for the data? 

Jot down the sites you find, the places you're going to look, or the people you'll need to ask about the data -- be as specific as possible, i.e., what data you're after, and how you're going to get it -- and post them in the [course forum](http://learn.codelesson.com/mod/forum/view.php?id=3386).
