Please take a moment to introduce yourself over [here](http://learn.codelesson.com/mod/forum/view.php?id=3386) in the [Code Lesson forum for Crunching Public Data](http://learn.codelesson.com/mod/forum/view.php?id=3386). Post a few sentences about who you are, where you're located in the world, and what you are the most interested in learning during the course. Bonus points for recording a short video introduction and posting a link to that. 

Here are some useful tools for recording a video introduction:

* [YouTube's](http://youtube.com) "[Record Video from Webcam](http://www.youtube.com/my_webcam)" feature
* [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com) (for posting longer videos)
* [Screenr](http://www.screenr.com/), for recording your screen without extra software
* [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/about), for uploading slides plus an audio track

Use this simple exercise to get familiarized with the Code Lesson forum.a
